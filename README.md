# simple-7zip-powershell
A simple wrapper to make 7zip extraction and compression work similarly to the zip command in Linux. Also made an interactive version.

## 7zip_unzip.ps1
This is the interactive version (double click to run and follow prompts)

## 7zip_unzip_function.ps1
This is more similar to the zip command in Linux bash shell. Run the file, and then you should be able to use it. Instructions in the comments and the 'help' function.
